# Data-Science-project-
This project overviews current spam detection mechanisms and identifies the challenges of existing email filtering gaps to detect phishing emails and check for any malicious attack.
The steps we followed are:
➢ Business understanding: We clearly defined the problem statement, which is to detect and prevent email phishing and scams. We also defined the objective of the project, which is to improve the security of email communications by accurately identifying phishing and scams.

➢ Analytic Approach: We decided on the appropriate machine learning
algorithms to use based on our research and exploratory data analysis. We also determined the metrics to evaluate the model's performance.

➢ Data Requirements: We identified the type and quantity of data needed to build the model and improve its accuracy.

➢ Data Collection: We collected the data needed for our project from various sources, including public datasets and real-world email communications.

➢ Data Understanding: We performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data, including the distribution of features and target variables.

➢ Data Preparation: We prepared the data by cleaning, transforming, and integrating it, in order to make it suitable for modeling.

➢ Modeling: We built and evaluated several machine learning models using the prepared data. We compared the performance of different models using the metrics defined in the analytic approach step.

➢ Evaluation: We evaluated the performance of the models and selected the best-performing model based on its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

➢ Deployment: We deployed the best-performing model into a production environment, making it available for real-world usage, a web application and chrom extension.
